### Environment & Economic

**Summary**

This project aims to elucidate the complex relationships between carbon dioxide emissions, sustainable energy practices, and key economic indicators in the G20 nations from 2000-2020. Leveraging comprehensive datasets sourced from Kaggle, the analysis will examine how variables such as renewable energy share, low-carbon electricity percentage, and CO2 emissions correlate with economic measures like GDP per capita, GDP growth rates, and exchange rates.

**Data Sources**

I utilized the open datasets from Kaggle:

[Global Data on Sustainable Energy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy)

This dataset presents an analysis of sustainable energy indicators and various relevant factors across all countries from the year 2000 to 2020.

[CO2 Emission by countries Year wise](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moazzimalibhatti/co2-emission-by-countries-year-wise-17502022)

This dataset will facilitate predictions regarding global warming.


[G20 Countries' Currency Exchange Rates against USD](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedharris/g20-countries-currency-exchange-rates-against-usd)

This dataset includes the currency exchange rates of G20 countries in relation to the US dollar, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the macroeconomic landscape.

**Project Goals**

Collect and preprocess data from multiple sources.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights.

Develop an interactive tool (dashboard or recommendation engine or Conversational agent) to visualize findings.

Utilize Python for data wrangling, visualization, and modeling.

**Interactive Dashboard**

Geospatial patterns (G20 countries)

Time series trends (Economic indicator/CO2 emission/Sustainable Energy)
